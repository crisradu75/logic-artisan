# Resolving `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`

The full rule behind the short form at the top of six skills' `SKILL.md`.

Commands in this skill and its reference
files name plugin files as `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/...`. That placeholder is this
plugin's install directory, and Claude Code substitutes it into skill content --
but it is **not** an environment variable in the Bash tool. If you ever see the
literal text `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` in a command you are about to run, resolve
it yourself first; never pass it through to a shell, where an unset variable
expands to nothing and the command silently runs against `/skills/...`.

To resolve it: the harness prepends a `Base directory for this skill: <absolute
path>` line when it loads a skill. The plugin root is that path with the trailing
`/skills/<skill-name>` removed. Failing that, take the absolute path of any file
you have already read from this plugin and cut it at the `.../plugins/cla`
segment. If you cannot establish it either way, say so and stop rather than
guessing a path.

Measured, so you know which half is load-bearing: a `SKILL.md` body arrives with
the placeholder ALREADY substituted, so commands written here are safe. A
`references/` file is opened with `Read`, which returns the raw bytes — the
placeholder arrives literal there, and that is the case this rule exists for.
