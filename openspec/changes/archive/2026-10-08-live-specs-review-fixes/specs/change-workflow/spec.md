## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Specs follow the repo's authoring rules

Skills that write or review an OpenSpec change SHALL apply the `rules:` block in the repo's `openspec/config.yaml`, which the plugin seeds from its shipped `rules:` block to keep specs to outcomes and interfaces in short requirements.

#### Scenario: A requirement describing internal steps

- **WHEN** a change adds a requirement that describes how a skill sequences its own steps
- **THEN** `/cla:review-change` reports it as a finding

#### Scenario: A repo edits its rules

- **WHEN** a repo changes a rule in its `openspec/config.yaml`
- **THEN** the next change authored by the plugin follows the changed rule

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Options for one change's run

`/cla:spec-to-pr` SHALL accept `--review-rounds N`, `--test-rounds N` and `--pr-rounds N` to cap the review before implementation, the test-fix rounds and the pull request review rounds, `--skip-review` to skip the pull request review, `--gate-on-push` or `--interactive` to pause before pushing, `--pr-base <branch>` to build on and open against another branch, `--narrow` for narrower permission rules, and `--dry-run` to run every check while writing nothing.

#### Scenario: Skipping the pull request review

- **WHEN** a user runs `/cla:spec-to-pr` with `--pr-rounds 0`
- **THEN** no review round runs on the opened pull request

#### Scenario: A dry run

- **WHEN** a user runs `/cla:spec-to-pr` with `--dry-run`
- **THEN** every check runs and no commit, push, pull request or file edit is made

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Round caps and a dry run

**Reason**: It listed five of the skill's documented options and left out the rest.

**Migration**: Restated as change-workflow / Options for one change's run, which names every option a user passes.
